# Running little command line tools found on Github

Running command line scripts found on Github is simple and fun! Below can help you get started. 

## Install

### Step1: 
Click the green "Code" button and then click the "Download Zip" option to download the code and then double click on the zip file to unzip it once downloaded.

### Step2: 
Drag and drop in a file from your downloaded folder into the terminal app and hit enter after prefixing with the proper command from below. 

## Terminal
Find the terminal app (Terminal.app) on your Mac and open it! You'll then see a blinking cursor just like you would in a Word doc and this is where you can enter your commands using the formats detailed below for the language of the script you're using. 

## Script types
Once you open terminal, just type in the necessary term for the language you are using ("bash" or "php" or "python") and then drag the script into the terminal window which will print the full path to the file and hit enter. 

### Bash
Bash ends in ".sh" for shell 
```
bash myscript.sh
```

### PHP
Php is an easy one
```
php myscript.php
```

### Python
Python is also simple but could also have to add the version of python you're using to the end if just typing  `python` does not work. 
```
python3 myscript.py
```
